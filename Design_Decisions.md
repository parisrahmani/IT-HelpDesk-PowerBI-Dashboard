# Design Decisions & Analytical Reasoning

## Legacy Data Exclusion
Historical issues lacking priority and resolution timestamps were identified as legacy records. These issues were excluded from performance metrics to prevent distortion, while their proportion was reported separately to maintain transparency.

## Metric Selection
Metrics were selected to reflect executive-level concerns, including issue intake trends, resolution efficiency, and process bottlenecks. Percentages were used where volume differences could mislead interpretation.

## Visualization Choices
Line charts were used for time-based trends, while bar charts were chosen for categorical comparisons. A 100% stacked column chart was used to emphasize resolution efficiency independent of issue volume.

## Visual Hierarchy and Color Usage
Semantic colors were applied to status indicators (green for closed, red for open), while neutral tones were used for diagnostic charts to reduce visual noise and maintain focus on key performance indicators.
