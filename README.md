## Project Context
Designed as an executive-level dashboard for IT Services leadership to monitor issue trends, resolution performance, and process efficiency.

## Key Questions Answered
- How does issue volume change over time?
- Are issues being resolved efficiently?
- Where do process bottlenecks occur?
- How reliable is the underlying data?

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX

## Key Insights
- Issue intake shows seasonal variation with lower demand from spring through late summer.
- Closure rates remain consistently high, indicating capacity alignment during lower-intake periods.
- Medium-priority issues exhibit longer resolution times, suggesting optimization opportunities.
- Workflow analysis highlights specific process phases contributing most to resolution delays.

## Data Quality Considerations
Legacy issues lacking priority and resolution timestamps were excluded from performance metrics and reported separately to maintain analytical integrity.
